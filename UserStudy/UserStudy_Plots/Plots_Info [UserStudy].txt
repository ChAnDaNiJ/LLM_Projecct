This folder called UserStudy_Plots contains all images that helps visualize and understand UserStudy dataset better.

1. Arousal_Class [UserStudy].png
This bar chart shows how a machine learning model performs on classifying "Arousal_Class" in a user study, based on different amounts of training data (from 10% to 90%).
- Performance improves as more training data is used. You can see that bars generally get taller from left (10%) to right (90%).
- Precision and ROC_AUC are the highest metrics, especially at 90%, both close to or at 1 (perfect).
- Recall is lower than other metrics, especially with less training data — suggesting the model misses some positive cases early on.
- F1_Score catches up only after 60% data — showing the model needs more data to balance precision and recall well.
As the amount of training data increases, the model's performance across all metrics improves significantly,
with precision and ROC\_AUC reaching near-perfect levels, while recall and F1 score show noticeable gains after 60% data usage.

2. FewShot - Split_Performance [UserStudy].png
This chart shows how well a few-shot learning model performs on valence and arousal classification tasks as the training data increases from 10% to 90%.
- Performance improves across the board with more data.
- Precision and ROC_AUC are strong for both tasks, especially at higher data levels.
- Recall is lower than precision at small data sizes, especially for arousal.
- F1 and F2 scores improve significantly after 50–60% data, meaning the model balances precision and recall better with more data.
- At 90%, both valence and arousal tasks reach high performance — close to or above 0.9 in most metrics.
Model performance on both valence and arousal classification steadily improves with more training data,
with high precision and ROC_AUC throughout and stronger recall and F1/F2 scores emerging after 60%.

3. Split_Distribution [UserStudy].png
This chart shows how performance metrics for valence and arousal classification are built up from different amounts of training data, ranging from 10% to 90% (Series1 to Series9).
- Valence tasks perform better than arousal tasks, especially in accuracy and ROC_AUC.
- Arousal Recall and F2 have the lowest total height, suggesting the model struggles with these even as training data increases.
- Each additional data split (from 10% up) adds to performance, shown by the layered bar structure.
This chart shows that model performance improves steadily as more training data is added, with valence classification consistently outperforming arousal classification, especially in recall and F2 score.

4. Valence_Class [UserStudy].png
This chart shows how well a model performs at predicting valence class (emotional positivity/negativity) in a user study, depending on how much training data is used — from 10% to 90%.
- Accuracy, Recall, and ROC_AUC improve steadily with more training data.
- Precision stays fairly consistent, even dipping slightly at higher data sizes — possibly due to the model becoming more inclusive (higher recall).
- F1_Score increases gradually, reflecting a better balance between precision and recall as data grows.
- With 90% training data, the model hits high marks on Accuracy (~0.9) and ROC_AUC (~0.85+), showing strong overall performance.
Model performance on valence classification improves steadily with more training data, achieving high accuracy and ROC_AUC by 90%, with recall driving most of the gains.

5. ZeroShot - Metrics [UserStudy].png
This chart shows how a model performs on valence and arousal classification tasks in a zero-shot setting across 5 different runs.
- the model shows modest and fairly consistent performance on both valence and arousal tasks,
- with valence precision and arousal recall being slightly stronger,
- but ROC AUC scores near 0.5 indicate minimal class separation ability without task-specific training.
